    <h4>The Early Years</h4>
    <p class="second">

        Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918.
        His
        mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the
        Acting
        King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father died and the
        young
        Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni. Hearing the elders’ stories of his
        ancestors’
        valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of
        his
        people.
